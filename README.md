Wordpress Quick Start Pack
==========================

I've created wordpress quickstart pack for faster theme development. Because, everyday I've convert PSD to HTML then Wordpress. After converting HTML, it is too annoying to convert in wordpress. In every theme, I've to do same things like create functions.php file, register widget, create theme options etc. 

That's why I did a quickstart pack for faster PSD to WP theme development. 

<strong>Included</strong>

<ul>
	<li>HTML5 Boilerplate</li>
	<li>Bootstrap</li>
	<li>Option tree</li>
</ul>
